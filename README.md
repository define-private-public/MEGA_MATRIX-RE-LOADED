MEGA_MATRIX RE: LOADED
======================

This is a fork of 
[MEGA_MATRIX](https://github.com/define-private-public/MEGA_MATRIX).  It is an
interlocking panel system.  An **N**x**M** matrix of 8x8 LED matrices 

 * You can find the firmware in `mm_arduino` (Arduino Uno's only).
 * You can find two applications to write images to MEGA_MATRIX RE:LOADED (MMR)
   in 'mm_py'
   * Use `png2mm.py` to create banners
   * Use `mm.py` to put those banners (or other animations) to MMR
   * Be sure to read the headers of the source to know how to use them

If you want to put anything else other than scrolling banners up on MMR read the
source of the applications to know how to write images.  From there, have your
own fun.
